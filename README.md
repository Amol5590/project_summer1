library management system
The Library Tracker System is a simple yet efficient console-based application written in C++ that helps manage a small library's inventory. It allows an administrator to add new books and lets users view available books, borrow them, return them, and see which books are currently borrowed. The system uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like classes, encapsulation, and data abstraction to manage books efficiently.
